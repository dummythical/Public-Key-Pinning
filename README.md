# Public Key Pinning Examples

This repository contains two implementations of a simple app that fetches data from a local server while verifying its public key.

- **Windows (Electron)** – the original Electron version of the app.
- **Android (React Native)** – a React Native variant using certificate pinning.

See the README in each folder for usage instructions.
